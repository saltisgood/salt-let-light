Let There Be Light
==============

Let There Be Light is a simple Android app that functions as both a torch and a screen brightness manager. The actual app can be viewed and downloaded from the [Play Store here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nickstephen.lighter).

This repository contains all the source code and resources and should build without any troubles {though you won't get my private keystore ;)}.

Feel free to view and modify what you like as long as you follow the rules of the license (i.e. give proper attributions).
